//! Specs declarativly define an edited video.
//!
//! A spec defines an output video (as a logical time-indexed array).
//! It creates this array by defining its domain (the set of times at which the spec is defined) and a function that maps each time to a frame.
//! The frame is represented as an [`FrameExpr`] expression.
//!
//! Specs are stateless and immutable. They are intended to be smaller than just storing the entire output video as an array.
//! Additionally, this generic spec interface allows the general case of a video-editing DSL, as done in V2V, while allowing for whatever language the use case needs.
