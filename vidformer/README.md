## About

* It's written in Rust 🦀
    * So it does some fancy parallel processing and does so safely
* Uses the [FFmpeg libav libraries](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) for multimedia stuff
    * So it should work with nearly every video file ever made
* Uses [Apache OpenDAL](https://opendal.apache.org/) for I/O
    * So it can access videos in a bunch of storage services
* Implements filters using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)


## Building

This crate requires linking with FFmpeg, as detailed in the `rusty_ffmpeg` crate.
We currently target FFmpeg 7.0.
