# Getting Started

Vidformer can be run in a cloud deployment (with the Igni server) or as a local process (with the Yrden server).

## In the cloud (start here):

Walk through a demo using a hosted guest account: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ixlab/vidformer/blob/main/misc/Colab_Vidformer.ipynb)

You can host an Igni server yourself ([here](https://github.com/ixlab/vidformer/tree/main/vidformer-igni)).

## Local:

Installing locally allows for accessing the local file system and saving video results.
