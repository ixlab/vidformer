# Getting Started

The fastest way to try vidformer is with the hosted demo: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ixlab/vidformer/blob/main/misc/Colab_Vidformer.ipynb)

For local development, see [Local Install](./install.md), then follow the [cv2 walkthrough](./getting-started-cv2.md).
