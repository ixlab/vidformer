# Getting Started

Vidformer can be run in a cloud deployment or locally.

## In the cloud (start here):

Walk through a demo using a hosted guest account: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ixlab/vidformer/blob/main/misc/Colab_Vidformer.ipynb)

## Local:

You can host a server yourself ([here](./install.md)).
Installing locally allows for accessing the local file system and saving video results.
